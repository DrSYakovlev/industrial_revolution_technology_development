        This little project is telling the story of some very useful things
        invented during the exciting period in modern history known to us as an
        <em>Industrial Revolution</em> (1760-1840). It is difficult to
        overestimate a significance of technical development which occured
        during that period of time.

      <p>
        We immediately recall a ubiquitous <em>steam engine</em> each time we
        hear 'Industrial Revolution'. This is probably the most recognisable
        invention. Iconic feature - the Hogwarts Express. The steam engine
        powered train is departing from King's Cross station, platform 9 3/4 in
        London on the image above.
      </p>

      <p>
        The present project tells more about some inventions we use every day
        and take for granted (except for a marine chronometer, which enabled
        safe navigation, great geographical discoveries and global trade). You
        will learn a bit about personalities beyond each invention and, of
        course the story of success when each invention was commerciolised. The
        project tells about five objects only - a drop in the ocean. We would
        require a serios research work to unvail this prolific period.

        While the quadrant and later the sextant allowed the measurement  of
        latitude at sea, longitude (the east-west) position could only be
        measured by reference to an accurate timepiece, or chronometer, onboard
        ship. In the 16th century, navigational and surveying techniques were
        not compatible with its use in navigation and the problems were: (a) The
        impossibility of determining the longitude at sea with adequate
        accuracy, and (b) Magnetic directions instead of geographical directions
        were used in navigation. On voyages, cumulative errors in
        <em> dead reckoning</em>dead reckoning frequently led to shipwrecks and
        lost lives. Avoiding maritime tragedies became an imperative in this
        ‘age of Sail’, as trade and navigation were massively expanding as a
        result of the <em>Industrial Revolution</em>. In 1714, the British
        government offered by Act of Parliament, £20,000 for solution which
        could provide a measurement of longitude to an accuracy within
        half-a-degree(two minutes of time ). The clockmaker John Harrison, who
        lad made some of the most accurate pendulum clocks the word have ever
        seen, developed a series of timepieces to solve the problem. Marine
        chronometer must be corrosion proof, shock-proof and unaffected by the
        sailing ship’s constant motion, temperature swings and changes of
        gravitational force. The moving parts were controlled and
        counterbalanced by springs so that it worked independently of the force
        of gravity. The latest and the most advanced versions (1761,
        Illustrated, from the site of Royal Museum Greenwich) looked like a very
        large pocket watch: on a voyage to Jamaica it lost only five seconds.
        Other successful trials were adopted across the world. For the first
        time, ships were able to navigate accurately using longitude. The marine
        chronograph became a key part of the old-day GPS.

        The Babylonians used “chewing sticks” for oral hygiene around 3500 BCE,
        which were basically twigs with frayed ends. In India, the twigs of the
        neem three were chewed until soft and then splayed to brush the teeth.
        In 1223, Chinese monks were recorded as cleaning their teeth with
        brushes made of horsetail hairs attached to an ox-bone handle. The first
        bristled toothbrush originated in china around 1500, the bristles coming
        from the necks and shoulders of pigs that lived in colder climates,
        where they grew longer, thicker hair. In 1690 we first come across the
        world “toothbrush” in the English language, when the antiquary Antony
        Wood records buying one. In 1770 William Addis was jailed for coasing a
        riot. While in prison he decided that the method used to clean teeth,
        rubbing a rag with sooth and salt across the teeth, could be improved.
        Addis found a small animal bone, drilled small holes in it, obtained
        some bristles from a guard, tied them in tufts, passed the tufts through
        the holes in the bone, and glued them in place. Another of his
        prototypes used a horsehair inserted in holes bored into bone and kept
        in place by thin wire. Addis was the first known mass-producer, starting
        a family firm selling toothbrushes, with handles carved out of cattle
        bones. He soon became very rich. By 1845 brushes were still being
        hand-produced frome bone or ivory with hair or bristle filaments. The
        bones used to make the brush backs and handles were from ox thighs and
        rumps, which had been boiled to remove fat and grease. The ends of the
        bones were cut off and sold to button-makers, as only the mid-sections
        were used by brush-makers. Fifty-three processes went into the making of
        an Addis toothbrush and the bristle-filling was mostly done by women
        working in their own homes. Pig bristle was used for cheaper
        toothbrushes and badger hair for the more expensive ones. In the 1860s
        Addis became one of the first manufacturers in the UK to use an
        automated manufacturing system, and in 1869 the first Addis toothbrush
        handle was made by machine. During the First World War, Addis supplied
        troops with toothbrushes, thereby creating a national “habit” of teeth
        cleaning. By 1926 the company was producing 1.8 million toothbrushes per
        year. 1927 saw the introduction of the first plastic-handled
        toothbrushes (made of celluloid), and brushes were filled with bristles
        mechanically. In the Second World War, a million brushes were supplied
        to the armed forces, and in 1940 the first nylon toothbrushes with
        plastic handles and plastic bristles were launched under the WISDOM
        brand. In 1938, DuPont had manufactured the first nylon bristle
        toothbrush. Animal bristle was not an ideal material as it harboured
        bacteria and did not dry well, with the bristles often falling out.
        Bone-handed production ended at Addis in 1947. The electrical toothbrush
        was first marketed in the United States in 1960 by Squibb, and called
        the Broxodent. General Electric introduced a rechargeable cordless
        toothbrush in 1961. Interplak was the first rotary action electrical
        toothbrush for home use, and it was introduced in 1987. In 1996, a
        management buy-out saw the end of the family-run Addis firm after 216
        years and three years later it was subject to a German takeover by EMSA
        Holding AG.

        Although soap was invented in Mesopotamia around 2800 BCE, credit is
        here being given to the first recognisably ‘modern’ soap. The ancient
        Mesopotamians somehow worked out that mixing animal fat with wood ash
        makes a substance that can clean clothes and people. A formula for soap
        consisting of water, alkali and cassia oil was written on a Babylonian
        clay tablet around 2200 BCE. The Ebers Papyrus of 1550 BCE tells us that
        the Egyptians bathed regularly, and combined animal and vegetable oils
        with alkaline salts to create a soap-like substance. The Romans built
        public baths all over their empire, but did not use the soap. They
        cleaned themselves by oiling their bodies, then scraping off the oil
        using a special scraper called a <em>strigil</em>. Rich Romans would
        employ a slave to scrape them clean. People were making soap in Europe
        from the 600s, but personal hygiene was not of real importance. Soap was
        costly and it remained a luxury item through the ages until the middle
        of the 19th century. It was made by boiling tallow (animal fat) or
        vegetable oils with alkali containing wood ash. Methods of soap-making
        improved with two scientific discoveries. In 1790 the French chemist
        Nicolas Leblank (1742-1806) invented a process for creating sodium
        hydroxide (caustic soda) from sodium chloride (common table salt).This
        made cheap soap manufacturing by enabling chemists to develop a
        procedure whereby natural fats and oils could react with caustic soda.
        The method was further refined when the French chemist Michel Eugene
        Chevreul (1786-1889) discovered the nature of fats and oils in 1823. As
        soap production became less expensive and attitudes towards personal
        cleanness changed, soap-making became an important industry. Until the
        Industrial Revolution, soap-making was a small-scale business, and the
        resulting product was uneven and gritty. Andrew Pears opened a barber’s
        shop in the then fashionable residential area Soho, London, and
        attracted the custom of wealthy families. He knew that the London upper
        class cultivated a delicate white complexion, while a tanned face was
        associated with the working class who toilet in the open air. Andrew
        Pears attempted to develop a gentle soap, and found a way of removing
        the impurities and refining the base soap, before adding the perfume. He
        began making a high-quality transparent soap in 1789 which had
        longer-lasting bubbles. Its transparency was the unique selling
        proposition that established the image of Pears soap. His method of
        mellowing, and ageing for over two months, each long-lasting soap bar is
        used today. Natural oils and pure glycerine are combined with the
        fragrances of rosemary, cedar and thyme. Now it smells more like coal
        tar, unfortunately, after a recent alteration in its composition. Pears
        Soap was the world’s first registered brand, and is therefore the
        world’s oldest continuously existing brand. The actress Lillie Langtry’s
        famous ivory complexion made her money as the first woman to endorse a
        commercial product, advertising Pears Soap.

        The development of the alphabet, writing and reading are possibly the
        most important landmarks in human history. However it was only the
        appearance of easy-to-use writing implements such as the pen and pencil
        that made mass education and literacy possible. Pencils allowed everyone
        to write easily and cheaply. The origins of the pencil date to the
        ancient Egyptians and Romans, who used to write with a <em>stylus</em>.
        This was a thin, short metal stick, often made of lead, which was used
        to scratch words onto wax-covered papyrus. Pens were fashioned from the
        quills of feather, and used by monks to write manuscripts. The quill pen
        was still being used into the 20th century. In 1564 a huge cache of
        graphite was discovered in Borrowdale, Cumbria, England. This remains
        the only large-scale deposit of pure graphite ever found in this pure
        form. Local residents used it to mark sheep, and soon discovered that
        they could cut graphite into sticks and carry it with them. Because
        graphite easily breaks, users in Italy began hollowing a stick of
        juniper wood and filling it with graphite to protect the mineral. Later
        versions sandwiched the graphite between two pensils halves and glued
        them together, the method still used today. The wooden sleeve prevents
        the core from breaking and also from marking the user’s hand during use.
        In 1662 the first mass-produced pencils were made in Nuremberg, Germany,
        using powdered graphite, sulphur and antymony. Conté was a French army
        officer, balloonist and painter, and he was asked by the French
        political leader Lazare Carnot to develop pencil that did not rely on on
        foreign imports. Britain, the only supplier in the world of the pure
        graphite sticks needed for pencils, was blockading the French Republic,
        and France was also unable to import the inferior German graphite pencil
        substitute. Conté discovered how to reconstitute graphite powder from
        other mines, and mixed this powdered graphite with clay. The mixture was
        formed into rods that were that fired in a kiln. He then pressed the
        rods between two half-cylinders of wood. He received a patent in 1795,
        forming a company which still makes pencils. He also invented the Conté
        crayon, a hard pastel stick used by artists. In 1770, the English
        engineer Edward Naime created and began selling the first rubber
        erasers. The practice of painting pencils yellow began in 1890s. Pencil
        manufacturers wanted to advertise that they were using high-quality
        Chinese graphite, so they painted them a colour associated with Chinese
        royalty. Today, 75% of pensils sold in the United States are still
        painted yellow. By the end of the 19th century more than 240,000 pencils
        were used each day in the United States alone. The favoured timber was
        red cedar, as it was aromatic and did not splinter when sharpened.
        Pencils create marks via physical abrasion, leaving behind a trail of
        solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface.
        By varying the ratio of graphite to clay, the hardness of the graphite
        rod can also be varied. Derwent produces twenty grades from 9H (very
        hard) to 9B (brittle, very soft) for its graphic pencils. Over 14
        billion pencils are manufactured worldwide annually.

        Alessandro Volta became a professor of physics at the Royal School in
        Como in 1774 and in the following year he devised the
        <em>electrophorus</em>, a device that produced charges of static
        electricity. The capacitive generator uses the process of electrostatic
        induction to produce the electric charge. A version had been invented in
        1762, but Volta improved and popularized the device. In 1776-7 he
        applied himself to chemistry, studying atmospheric electricity and
        devising experiments such as the ignition of gasses by an electric
        discharge in a closed vessel. The year 1777 saw Volta researching the
        chemistry of gasses and discovering methane. Luigi Galvani had noted
        ‘animal electricity, when two dissimilar metals were connected in series
        with severed frog’s leg, and to one another. Volta realized that the
        frog’s legs served as both a conductor of electricity (an electrolyte)
        and as a detector of electricity. He replicated the experiment using
        brine-soaked paper instead of a frog’s leg. By 1800 he had developed the
        so-called <em>voltaic pile</em>, a forerunner of the electric battery,
        which was the first battery to produce a reliable, steady current of
        electricity. A battery is a device that stores energy and makes it
        available in an electrical form, by converting chemical energy into
        electric energy. It is so called because it is a connected bunch (or
        <em>battery</em>) of electrochemical devices. Volta’s battery is
        credited as being the first electrochemical cell, consisting of
        alternating discs, or electrodes, of copper and one of zinc. The
        electrolyte sandwiched between the metals could be cardboard soaked in
        sulphuric acid of a birne mixture of salt and water. Volta also sent an
        electric current along insulated wire a distance of 30 miles (48 km)
        from Como to Milan to set off a pistol. This was a forerunner of the
        telegraph, which also uses a current to sent signals over long distance.
        He additionally made discoveries in pneumatics, electrostatics and
        meteorology. In honour of his work in the field of electricity, Napoleon
        made Volta a count in 1810, and in 1815 the emperor of Austria named him
        a professor of philosophy at Padua. His works were later published in
        five volumes in Florence, and in 1881 the electricalamed after him.
        Batteries are a worldwide power source today, generating over $50
        billion in annual sales.
